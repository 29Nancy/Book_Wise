BookWise Library Management System
Welcome to the BookWise Library Management System! BookWise is a simple and efficient library management system designed to help you organize and manage your library's collection of books. This README file will provide you with an overview of the project structure and how to use each of the three main directories: book_main, book_user, and book_issue.

Project Structure
book_main: This is the main directory of the BookWise library management system. It contains the core functionality and the database for storing information about books, authors, and categories.

book_user: This directory contains the user interface and functionalities for library patrons. Users can browse the catalog, search for books, and check their account information.

book_issue: This directory handles book issuing and returning processes. Librarians can use this module to manage book loans and keep track of due dates.
